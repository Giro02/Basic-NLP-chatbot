The sequence of these nucleotides determines the genetic information stored in the DNA. The DNA molecule consists of two strands twisted together to form a double helix structure. The nucleotides on each strand pair up with each other through hydrogen bonds, with A always pairing with T and G always pairing with C. DNA is found in the nucleus of cells and carries the genetic information that is passed down from one generation to the next. It is essential for the functioning and survival of all living things.':['what','is','dna'],
